"""
This file contains the training and test sentences used for developing,
testing and debugging our grammar for SHAPELURN
The functions at the end generate a training data set and a test data set
based on the gold lexicon and the grammar in grammar.py
The code is taken from Christopher Potts and Percy Liang (see below) and
we replaced their train and test utterances with our sentences
