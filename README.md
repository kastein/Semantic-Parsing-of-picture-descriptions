# Semantic-Parsing-of-picture-descriptions
This project is part of the Softwareproject "Language, Action and Perception".

General research question:  Can we implement a model that learns a natural language from scratch through interaction?

Focused research question:  Can we teach a computer a mapping from natural language picture descriptions to a logical representation?

# SHAPELURN: An Interactive Language Learning Game

## Demo of the Prototype

To play the Prototype of our language learning game you only have to clone the repository and run the gui_simple.py script. 
You will be asked to enter a name for your session and the programm will then create a new folder with your chosen name in the source code directory. 
In this folder the result data from your game  will be stored. (If your are testing the game for us in order to collect data for our evaluation of the system, this folder contains all the data we need from you.)

**Requirements**<br>
Python 3 <br>
tkinter <br>
PIL <br>
PySimpleGUI <br>
Numpy <br>

## Basic Instructions 

Hello! Welcome to SHAPELURN, where you can teach the computer any language of your choice!<br>
You will be looking at different pictures and describing them to the computer in one sentence. <br>
Please use rather short sentences and try not to use negation and conjunction."

In order to evaluate our model we would like to collect your data.<br>
Please enter any name under which you would like to save your data.

For the detailed instructions and examples please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/itsLuisa/Semantic-Parsing-of-picture-descriptions/wiki)
