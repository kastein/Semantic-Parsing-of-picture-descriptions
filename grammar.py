"""
Defines our grammar: the lexicon (which actually is not used in the game when learning from scratch), the CFG rules
and the functions on how to evaluate the logical forms with respect to a current Picture Object
It also includes the CKY parser used to parse the input utterances and convert into logical forms

Terminology:
Difference between referenced and guessed blocks:
for sentences like "there is a red circle" both refer to the same Block objects, i.e. the objects of all red circles in the Picture
but for e.g. the sentence "there is a green triangle over a red square over a circle" referenced blocks consists of
all green triangles that are over red squares that are over any circle
whereas guessed blocks consists of all green triangles, red squares and circles that make this sentence true
