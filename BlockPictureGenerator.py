"""
This script contains the code for randomly creating pictures in .png format that the Players are shown in the game.
The pictures display a grid (lines not shown) with different geomtric shapes in different colours.
The colours, shapes and positions are chosen randomly for each created picture.
The number of blocks can be defined in order to control for different complexity in different levels.
